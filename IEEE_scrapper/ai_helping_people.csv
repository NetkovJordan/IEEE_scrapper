Explained Artificial Intelligence Helps to Integrate Artificial and Human Intelligence Into Medical Diagnostic Systems: Analytical Review of Publications,"['Mais Farkhadov', 'Aleksander Eliseev', 'Nina Petukhova']","Artificial intelligence-based medical systems can by now diagnose various disorders highly accurately. However, we should stress that despite encouraging and ever improving results, people still distrust such systems. We review relevant publications over the past five years, to identify the main causes of such mistrust and ways to overcome it. Our study showes that the main reasons to distrust these systems are opaque models, blackbox algorithms, and potentially unrepresentful training samples. We demonstrate that explainable artificial intelligence, aimed to create more user-friendly and understandable systems, has become a noticeable new topic in theoretical research and practical development. Another notable trend is to develop approaches to build hybrid systems, where artificial and human intelligence interact according to the teamwork model.",2020 IEEE 14th International Conference on Application of Information and Communication Technologies (AICT),07-09 October 2020,09 March 2021,"Tashkent, Uzbekistan",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9368576/

Human Robot Interaction System for Behavioral Improvement of Autistic Children,"['Md. Parvez Hossain', 'Md. Atikuzzaman', 'Md. Mushfikur Rahim', 'Md. Tuzammel Hossain', 'Monira Sultana Mousome', 'Muhammad Aminur Rahaman']","An estimated one-third of people with autism are nonverbal. Many Research has been done in this field and confirms that people with autism experience a lack of communication skills, anxiety, dealing with change, bullying, etc. To assist autistic children and to improve their behavior, we have developed an artificial intelligence robot that can react to their movement via an ultrasonic sensor and can talk to them via voice commands. Using this robot, children with ASD can develop both their behavior and communication skill. The robot works in two methods. The first one is the ultrasonic sensor, implemented with an AI algorithm that can detect a person within seventy centimeters. This ultrasonic sensor sends the data to the controller and the controller receives the signal and sends an activation signal to the robot. Finally, the robot moves his head to the direction of the person is located or to the moving direction. The second method is voice commands. The robot can perform each physical action it is given via voice commands like a salute, handshaking, body movement, and answering questions achieving 97.75% average accuracy with the response time of 328.75ms. This accuracy is achieved by testing the system for 10 iterations. As autistic children hesitate to communicate freely with normal people, this human-robot interaction will improve their behavior and communication skills as well. This humanoid robot will improve the quality of living of the autistic or disabled people. This humanoid robot can be used in any public sector like school, colleges, an autism center, and industry.",2020 2nd International Conference on Advanced Information and Communication Technology (ICAICT),28-29 November 2020,01 February 2021,"Dhaka, Bangladesh",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9333508/
Real-Time Sign Language Converter for Mute and Deaf People,"['Akshit J Dhruv', 'Santosh Kumar Bharti']","Deaf people may get irritated due to the problem of not being able to share their views with common people, which may affect their day-to-day life. This is the main reason to develop such system that can help these people and they can also put their thoughts forward similar to other people who don’t have such problem. The advancement in the Artificial intelligence provides the door for developing the system that overcome this difficulty. So this project aims on developing a system which will be able to convert the speech to text for the deaf person, and also sometimes the person might not be able to understand just by text, so the speech will also get converted to the universal sign language. Similarly, for the mute people the sign language which they are using will get converted to speech. We will take help of various ML and AI concepts along with NLP to develop the accurate model. Convolutional neural networks (CNN) will be used for prediction as it is efficient in predicting image input, also as lip movements are fast and continuous so it is hard to capture so along with CNN, the use of attention-based long short-term memory (LSTM) will prove to be efficient. Data Augmentation methods will be used for getting the better results. TensorFlow and Keras are the python libraries that will be used to convert the speech to text. Currently there are many software available but all requires the network connectivity for it to work, while this device will work without the requirement of internet.Using the proposed model we got the accuracy of 100% in predicting sign language and 96% accuracy in sentence level understanding.",2021 International Conference on Artificial Intelligence and Machine Vision (AIMV),24-26 September 2021,10 January 2022,"Gandhinagar, India",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9670928/
Explainable AI for COVID-19 CT Classifiers: An Initial Comparison Study,"['Qinghao Ye', 'Jun Xia', 'Guang Yang']","Artificial Intelligence (AI) has made leapfrogs in development across all the industrial sectors especially when deep learning has been introduced. Deep learning helps to learn the behaviour of an entity through methods of recognising and interpreting patterns. Despite its limitless potential, the mystery is how deep learning algorithms make a decision in the first place. Explainable AI (XAI) is the key to unlocking AI and the black-box for deep learning. XAI is an AI model that is programmed to explain its goals, logic, and decision making so that the end users can understand. The end users can be domain experts, regulatory agencies, managers and executive board members, data scientists, users that use AI, with or without awareness, or someone who is affected by the decisions of an AI model. Chest CT has emerged as a valuable tool for the clinical diagnostic and treatment management of the lung diseases associated with COVID-19. AI can support rapid evaluation of CT scans to differentiate COVID-19 findings from other lung diseases. However, how these AI tools or deep learning algorithms reach such a decision and which are the most influential features derived from these neural networks with typically deep layers are not clear. The aim of this study is to propose and develop XAI strategies for COVID-19 classification models with an investigation of comparison. The results demonstrate promising quantification and qualitative visualisations that can further enhance the clinician's understanding and decision making with more granular information from the results given by the learned XAI models.",2021 IEEE 34th International Symposium on Computer-Based Medical Systems (CBMS),07-09 June 2021,12 July 2021,"Aveiro, Portugal",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9474739/

Real-Time Prediction of Intradialytic Hypotension via GRU and Explainable AI,"['Yu-Cheng Chen', 'Wei-Chung Wang', 'Che-Wen Chen', 'Hsiang-Wei Hu', 'Jhing-Fa Wang']","Kidney disease is a common civilized illness for humans. The population of kidney dialysis in Taiwan exceeded 85,000 in 2017 and continued to increase by 6% per year. Intradialytic hypotension is the one of most common complication. Therefore, we hope to predict the occurrence of hypotension in the next 30 minutes as a target. However, there are too many factors that may cause hypotension, which makes it much more difficult to predict. Blood pressure and physical data are both time-dependent features. Therefore, The gated recurrent unit (GRU) network is used to predict the time series effectively. And Local Interpretable Model-Agnostic Explanation (LIME) XAI is used to interpret the prediction results to help people understand the causes of low blood pressure. The model prediction results have good performance in both binary classification and regression.

Research on roBERTa-based fraudulent information identification and interpretable AI,"['Xiangwu Ding', 'Yue Ding']","Fraudulent information identification helps people detect fraud traps in time and has certain social practical significance. At present, most of the methods with better effect on fraudulent information identification are based on deep learning, but the identification effect still needs to be improved. Secondly, the poor interpretability of the deep learning models themselves is an important obstacle to their practical implementation. To address these two issues, this paper proposes to apply the pre-trained model roBERTa to the fraudulent information identification task, and later interpret the prediction results based on LIME. The experimental results show that roBERTa achieves optimal results on the fraudulent information identification task compared to the three related benchmark models. In addition, the interpretation of the prediction results proves that roBERTa’s predictions are reliable, which lays the foundation for the practical implementation of roBERTa in fraudulent information identification scenarios.",2021 International Conference on Computer Information Science and Artificial Intelligence (CISAI),17-19 September 2021,28 February 2022,"Kunming, China",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9719007/

Recipe Bot: The Application of Conversational AI in Home Cooking Assistant,['Jiawen Chu'],"Conversational Artificial Intelligence (AI), which allows people to have human-like interactions with computers, has experienced a boom in recent years. A wide range of fields such as healthcare, finance, and retail have applied conversational AI in their websites to save efforts of completing easy tasks and provide voice interaction with end-users. It enables customers to find quick answers to frequently asked questions and service providers to save time to tackle more complex problems. This paper introduces the Recipe Bot, which is a conversational agent that provides matching recipes based on the information given by users. The intention of Recipe Bot is to help users get rid of unused ingredients in the fridge by providing related recipes. Recipe Bot allows users to input a specific dish name or provide a region, type, and/or ingredients of the food they would like to have, and then it returns a recipe list according to sorting and nutrients requirements given by users. The chatbot is built using Google Dialogflow platform to recognize the user’s intentions and Spoonacular API to find recipes that match the search query. This paper discusses Recipe Bot’s architecture, functionality, and inadequacies to be improved.

AI-based content filtering system using an age prediction algorithm,"['Ashutosh Upadhyay', 'Karthikeyan. S']","Computer vision mainly focuses on the automatic extraction, analysis, and understanding of useful information from a single image or video. On the other hand, authenticity is emerging as one of the primary requirements in today's world by developing a system for computer vision complexity. Generally, two robust techniques such as age estimation and face recognition are required to maintain authenticity. In reality, fraud and scams are getting increased, so here this paper has proposed a new combined model for face recognition and age prediction. Face recognition has been implemented and presented in this paper by using a Deep Neural Network. The authenticity problem can be handled by using either facial recognition or age prediction alone; this study has presented a method that employs both of them together to enhance the system's robustness. So, first, this model detects the person's face, and then it predicts the person's age. If the individual is eligible to view the information or perform a task, their access will be limited; otherwise, their access will be restricted. So it helps to solve two difficulties in this case: the person's identification cannot be faked, and their age is also confirmed by the system.

In this paper we present a novel on-device solution for detecting NSFW images. In addition to conventional pornographic content moderation, we have also included semi-nude content moderation as it is still NSFW in a large demography. We have curated a dataset comprising of three major categories, namely nude, semi-nude and safe images. We have created an ensemble of object detector and classifier for filtering of nude and semi-nude contents. The solution provides unsafe body part annotations along with identification of semi-nude images. We extensively tested our proposed solution on several public dataset and also on our custom dataset.

Semantic-Based Explainable AI: Leveraging Semantic Scene Graphs and Pairwise Ranking to Explain Robot Failures,"['Devleena Das', 'Sonia Chernova']","When interacting in unstructured human environments, occasional robot failures are inevitable. When such failures occur, everyday people, rather than trained technicians, will be the first to respond. Existing natural language explanations hand-annotate contextual information from an environment to help everyday people understand robot failures. However, this methodology lacks generalizability and scalability. In our work, we introduce a more generalizable semantic explanation framework. Our framework autonomously captures the semantic information in a scene to produce semantically descriptive explanations for everyday users. To generate failure-focused explanations that are semantically grounded, we lever-ages both semantic scene graphs to extract spatial relations and object attributes from an environment, as well as pairwise ranking. Our results show that these semantically descriptive explanations significantly improve everyday users’ ability to both identify failures and provide assistance for recovery than the existing state-of-the-art context-based explanations.",2021 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS),27 September 2021 - 01 October 2021,16 December 2021,"Prague, Czech Republic",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9635890/

Authentication is a key factor which helps for the identification of authorized people and helps in eradicating fraudulent activities, robberies, and many other social crimes. Most of the crimes are due to the vulnerabilities in the door locking systems which can be easily accessible by the outsiders. Though there are solutions like smart doorbells and video streaming, which have limitations like heavy cost, complex and have loopholes in the security issues. To diminish the limitations and to enhance the security Smart door unlock systems using face recognition is proposed.

The proposed system recognizes the face of the person standing in front of the door with the help AI-Thinker in the esp32-cam. The face of the person is compared with the faces of the authorized persons which are stored in the SD card of esp32-cam. If the person is an authorized person then the door gets unlocked which can be achieved with the hardware component solenoid lock.

Rehabilitation that can aid and enhance the lives of such patients is the need of the hour. Exoskeletons have been found as one of the popular means of rehabilitation. The existing exoskeletons use techniques that impose limitations on adaptability, instant response and continuous control. Also most of them are expensive, bulky, and requires high level of training. To overcome all the above limitations, this paper introduces an Artificial Intelligence (AI) powered Smart and light weight Exoskeleton System (AI-IoT-SES) which receives data from various sensors, classifies them intelligently and generates the desired commands via Internet of Things (IoT) for rendering rehabilitation and support with the help of caretakers for paralyzed patients in smart and connected communities. In the proposed system, the signals collected from the exoskeleton sensors are processed using AI-assisted navigation module, and helps the caretakers in guiding, communicating and controlling the movements of the exoskeleton integrated to the patients. The navigation module uses AI and IoT enabled Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM). The casualties of a paralyzed person are reduced by commissioning the IoT platform to exchange data from the intelligent sensors with the remote location of the caretaker to monitor the real time movement and navigation of the exoskeleton. The automated exoskeleton detects and take decisions on navigation thereby improving the life conditions of such patients.

Vitamin Deficiency Detection Using Image Processing and Neural Network,"['Ahmed Saif Eldeen', 'Mohamed AitGacem', 'Saifeddin Alghlayini', 'Wessam Shehieb', 'Mustahsan Mir']","In this paper, a cost-free Artificial Intelligence-based application for smartphones built to detect vitamin deficiencies in humans using pictures of specific body organs is introduced. Recent vitamin deficiency detection methods require costly laboratory analysis. A wide spectrum of vitamin deficiencies can show one or more visually distinguishable symptoms and indications that appear in multiple locations in the human body. The application provides individuals with the capability to diagnose their possible vitamin deficiencies without the need to provide blood samples through the analysis of photos taken of their eyes, lips, tongue, and nails. The application then suggests a list of nutritional sources to fight the detected deficiency and the expected complications through nutritional micro-correction. The intelligent software was trained to distinguish and differentiate vitamin deficiencies with high confidence from imagery inputs of the selected body parts that are known to show different symptoms in terms of changes in the tissue's structure when the human body suffers a nutritional deficit.

Any technological tool enabling rapid screening of the COVID-19 infection with high accuracy can be crucially helpful to the healthcare professionals. The main clinical tool currently in use for the diagnosis of COVID-19 is the Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), which is expensive, less-sensitive and requires specialized medical personnel. X-ray imaging is an easily accessible tool that can be an excellent alternative in the COVID-19 diagnosis. This research was taken to investigate the utility of artificial intelligence (AI) in the rapid and accurate detection of COVID-19 from chest X-ray images. The aim of this paper is to propose a robust technique for automatic detection of COVID-19 pneumonia from digital chest X-ray images applying pre-trained deep-learning algorithms while maximizing the detection accuracy. A public database was created by the authors combining several public databases and also by collecting images from recently published articles. The database contains a mixture of 423 COVID-19, 1485 viral pneumonia, and 1579 normal chest X-ray images. Transfer learning technique was used with the help of image augmentation to train and validate several pre-trained deep Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). The networks were trained to classify two different schemes: i) normal and COVID-19 pneumonia; ii) normal, viral and COVID-19 pneumonia with and without image augmentation. The classification accuracy, precision, sensitivity, and specificity for both the schemes were 99.7%, 99.7%, 99.7% and 99.55% and 97.9%, 97.95%, 97.9%, and 98.8%, respectively.

Many lives are lost, the labor markets are affected and the people lifestyle are changed in order to limit the impact of COVID-19 pandemic. As of now, it seems that the COVID vaccine is the only solution for the world to be safe again. In the United Kingdom and the United States, many studies have been conducted on the sentiment analysis where the emotions of participants before vaccination and after vaccination are observed. The first batch of vaccines has been launched at the end of 2020 while some developed countries started early vaccination campaigns, and others are still in the process of ordering vaccines and remained unvaccinated until early 2021. The vaccinations are prioritized on the high-risk groups, such as medical workers and the elderly population. Vaccination for people under age 18 are still not available in the initial stage. Despite the executions of vaccinations, there are various opinions on whether the COVID-19 vaccines are safe, and a number of the population remain skeptical of taking the vaccine. In this research, we analyze tweets to understand public perception on the COVID-19 vaccine by classifying the sentiments and attitudes towards the vaccination and the available types of vaccine [1]. Social media is an appropriate source of research to analyze public attitudes towards COVID-19 vaccine and what they feel about the various brands of the vaccine in the market. For this research, tweets written in two languages, English and Japanese, have been collected. In Japan, some related surveys on public willingness for vaccinations and the sentiment analysis are already conducted.

Masa: AI-Adaptive Mobile App for Sustainable Agriculture,"['Ruth Ogubuike', 'Ashfaq Adib', 'Rita Orji']","Mobile applications have made significant positive contributions to our daily lives in recent years. They have greatly improved practices in critical sectors such as healthcare, education, and agriculture etc. The agricultural sector is under pressure to meet the ever-increasing food demand while needing to deal with lack of agricultural resources (such as water and soil) and climate change issues. There is also a need to figure out how to attract and involve young people in agriculture in order to replace aging farmers. These issues necessitate the development of new, sustainable agricultural solutions. This is the demand that Masa app is attempting to meet. This paper presents the design and implementation of an AI-adaptive mobile app for sustainable agriculture. The app is divided into two sections: the market section which creates a platform where buyers are able to connect with the farmers directly and the resource center section where the power of AI is used to give guidance to the farmers. It also has learning resources where new entrants into the Agric sector can have first-hand walk-through guides in the Agric field containing all the information they need to venture into farming any product of choice. This will help mitigate some of the challenges faced by people who are new or venturing into the agricultural sector thereby encouraging more people to enter agriculture hence its sustainability.

Imagine a surveillance camera system that can detect various on-body weapons, masked faces, suspicious objects and traffic. This system could transform surveillance cameras from passive sentries into active observers which would help in preventing a possible mass shooting in a school, stadium or mall. In this paper, we present a prototype implementation of such systems, Hawk-Eye, an AI-powered threat detector for smart surveillance cameras. Hawk-Eye can be deployed on centralized servers hosted in the cloud, as well as locally on the surveillance cameras at the network edge. Deploying AI-enabled surveillance applications at the edge enables the initial analysis of the captured images to take place on-site, which reduces the communication overheads and enables swift security actions. At the cloud side, we built a Mask R-CNN model that can detect suspicious objects in an image captured by a camera at the edge. The model can generate a high-quality segmentation mask for each object instance in the image, along with the confidence percentage and classification time. The camera side used a Raspberry Pi 3 device, Intel Neural Compute Stick 2 (NCS 2), and Logitech C920 webcam. At the camera side, we built a CNN model that can consume a stream of images directly from an on-site webcam, classify them, and displays the results to the user via a GUI-friendly interface.

AI-Based Driving Data Analysis for Behavior Recognition in Vehicle Cabin,"['Friedrich Lindow', 'Christian Kaiser', 'Alexey Kashevnik', 'Alexander Stocker']","Driving a vehicle is an indispensable part of their everyday life for many people. However, sometimes this everyday life does not go as expected, as a lot of accidents happen on the public roads, and most of these accidents are due to inattentive driver behavior. Modern driver monitoring systems evaluate driver behavior by means of distinctive sensor technology and, if necessary, indicate undesirable driving behavior. However, many roadworthy vehicles do not have the possibility to implement such systems. Therefore, it seems to be interesting to investigate the implementation of such systems based on commodity hardware, e.g., smartphones, because nowadays almost every driver has a powerful smartphone equipped with many sensors at hand in the vehicle. Furthermore, recent advances in Machine Learning (ML) made it possible to analyze large amounts of data and to generate new outcomes. In this work we discuss how ML can be used for driver behavior recognition by improving an already existing threshold-based driver monitoring system with different ML-based techniques, Neural Networks and Random Forests, and evaluate their performance. We propose to use Microsoft Azure platform to analyze data generated by a Driver Monitoring System (DMS). Our results indicate ML as a useful technique for learning and adapting threshold-based reasoning about individual drivers' states.",2020 27th Conference of Open Innovations Association (FRUCT),07-09 September 2020,02 October 2020,"Trento, Italy",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9211020/

A Wireless Foot Plantar Pressure Distribution Measurement System and Its Application in Gait Analysis,"['Zheng Zhao', 'Weihai Chen', 'Zhang Yixin', 'Ai Pinghua', 'Jiahua Wang']","The foot plantar pressure distribution (FPPD) is time-varying in walking process, and study on foot plantar pressure distribution can help us analyze walking gait, which plays a key role in the research field of wearable device and auxiliary medical diagnosis. Especially for patients with leg or foot movement dysfunction, FPPD can help doctors to make scientific medical diagnosis results. As the foot plantar surface is irregular and flexible, it increases the difficulty of pressure distribution measurement. In this paper, an arrayed pressure-sensitive sensor is utilized to convert the pressure signal to resistance signal, and the resistance signal is then converted to numerical signal by embedded signal processing system based on CC2530. At last, the data of FPPD is uploaded to computer via wireless ZIGBEE network.

An Integrated AI Medical Diagnosis Application Based on Deep Learning,"['Haoyang Li', 'Xiaoyang Li', 'Bolin Shen', 'Zhi Zheng']","AI medical diagnosis has become an easy and effective approach method by which patients could get their health reports faster. This paper introduced an integrated AI medical diagnosis application with an image recognition system, chat system, and user interface. With the powerful help of the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), an accurate image diagnosis system for breast cancer is ready to use. The chat system provides a bond between AI and patients through communication, using the Q&A sub-system based on Knowledge Graph (KG) and the casual chat sub-system based on Natural Language Process (NLP). Health condition query and common converse are satisfied respectively by Q&A sub-system and casual chat sub-system. Depending on the user’s intentional probability of medical problems, the casual chat system will interfere if the user’s intention is not matched in Knowledge Graph. Besides the deep learning part to process patient’s data, an easy-to-use user interface is also designed to guide people getting intended information, using Flask framework to offer API and jQuery to send a request. Our accuracy achieves 0.88 in breast cancer detection, and the result of GradCAM indicates the CNN network has a high performance on such a task.

It has alerted our minds to conscious approach of cleanliness and to avoid touching substances and surfaces with our bare hands. Technology has been a major frontier in combating COVID-19, with tools that helps us to conform to the new realities of life. Some of these technologies are not new but are being applied in new ways for reducing the spread of the virus. The airport act as a border link between countries where infected people can easily transmit the disease by handling some public facilities. Hence, prevention of the virus spread may not only be in physical (social) distancing but also a NO-TOUCH approach to facilities (like trolley) by making it autonomous.

Feasibility Analysis of Machine Learning Optimization on GPU-based Low-cost Edges,"['Jiashun Suo', 'Xingzhou Zhang', 'Shilei Zhang', 'Wei Zhou', 'Weisong Shi']","Many AI algorithms have been deployed on edge devices as edge computing has the advantages of reducing latency, saving network bandwidth, and protecting data privacy. Whether edge devices can run AI algorithms is an important challenge due to the low-power and low-cost characteristics of edge devices. Therefore, this paper analyzed the performance of optimization techniques by running YOLOv3 on a typical GPU-based low-cost edge device, NVIDIA Jetson Nano. YOLOv3 is a representative object detection algorithm, which is widely used as the benchmark in AI scenarios. We compared latency, memory, and power consumption of three deep learning frameworks, TensorFlow, PyTorch, and TensorRT. Then we squeezed the extreme performance using multiple optimization techniques, including model quantization, model parallelization, and image scaling on TensorRT. The running speed of YOLOv3 increases from 3.9FPS to 13.1FPS on NVIDIA Jetson Nano. It proves that the resource-limited edge device can run AI applications with high computing power requirements in a real-time manner.

Towards NIR-VIS Masked Face Recognition,"['Hang Du', 'Hailin Shi', 'Yinglu Liu', 'Dan Zeng', 'Tao Mei']","Near-infrared to visible (NIR-VIS) face recognition is the most common case in heterogeneous face recognition, which aims to match a pair of face images captured from two different modalities. Existing deep learning based methods have made remarkable progress in NIR-VIS face recognition, while it encounters certain newly-emerged difficulties during the pandemic of COVID-19, since people are supposed to wear facial masks to cut off the spread of the virus. We define this task as NIR-VIS masked face recognition, and find it problematic with the masked face in the NIR probe image. First, the lack of masked face data is a challenging issue for the network training. Second, most of the facial parts (cheeks, mouth, nose etc.) are fully occluded by the mask, which leads to a large amount of loss of information. Third, the domain gap still exists in the remaining facial parts. In such scenario, the existing methods suffer from significant performance degradation caused by the above issues. In this paper, we aim to address the challenge of NIR-VIS masked face recognition from the perspectives of training data and training method. Specifically, we propose a novel heterogeneous training method to maximize the mutual information shared by the face representation of two domains with the help of semi-siamese networks. In addition, a 3D face reconstruction based approach is employed to synthesize masked face from the existing NIR image. Resorting to these practices, our solution provides the domain-invariant face representation which is also robust to the mask occlusion. Extensive experiments on three NIR-VIS face datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and cross-dataset-generalization capacity of our method.",IEEE Signal Processing Letters ( Volume: 28),Not Available,Not Available,Not Available,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9399230/

Revamping Supermarkets With AI and RSSi,"['Prashant Kaushik', 'Anshul Sharma', 'Gurjit Singh Bhathal']","Super markets are mushrooming in every city as shopping has became a daily activity. An average person goes to shopping 1.6 times in a week and spends approximately 40 minuets there per visit. This sums up to around 60 hours every year. Around 15 of the time spent in the supermarkets is wasted due long billing queues and weighting for the turn. On public holidays and special discount days, there will be a significant upsurge in the number of customers. With the present system it sometimes becomes difficult to manage the rush. The traditional way of shopping in which people put the articles in the shopping cart and wait in the long queues at the billing counter is being followed pretty much since the opening of first supermarket. This paper proposes a feasible and cost effective method to save time and reduce queues at the billing counters with Artificial Intelligence. The goal is to design a shopping cart which uses AI and IoT to scan the product as soon as it is kept in the cart. People have been already developing these carts using RFIDs for years but the proposed project isn’t just about RFIDs.

Interpretable CNNs for Object Classification,"['Quanshi Zhang', 'Xin Wang', 'Ying Nian Wu', 'Huilin Zhou', 'Song-Chun Zhu']","This paper proposes a generic method to learn interpretable convolutional filters in a deep convolutional neural network (CNN) for object classification, where each interpretable filter encodes features of a specific object part. Our method does not require additional annotations of object parts or textures for supervision. Instead, we use the same training data as traditional CNNs. Our method automatically assigns each interpretable filter in a high conv-layer with an object part of a certain category during the learning process. Such explicit knowledge representations in conv-layers of the CNN help people clarify the logic encoded in the CNN, i.e., answering what patterns the CNN extracts from an input image and uses for prediction. We have tested our method using different benchmark CNNs with various architectures to demonstrate the broad applicability of our method. Experiments have shown that our interpretable filters are much more semantically meaningful than traditional filters.","IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence ( Volume: 43, Issue: 10, 01 October 2021)",Not Available,Not Available,Not Available,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9050545/

Finding Behavioural and Imaging Biomarkers of Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) using Artificial Intelligence: A Review,"['Sarah Sheikh', 'Khaled Shaban']","Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) is a serious ailment in mental health and is a medical illness that has a debilitating impact on a person's ability to think effectively. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), depression is the leading cause of disability with crippling nearly 350 million people globally. Accurate diagnosis and effective timely treatment are often challenging due to lack of early detection often due to lack of awareness, lack of effective diagnosing tools and sometimes, even a lack of trained mental health care practitioners. With high rates of comorbidity of MDD with other psychological diseases, it becomes imperative to delve deeper into finding effective biomarkers to easily distinguish the disease and effectively manage it. A dearth in finding effective ways to manage the disease has resulted in a high number of suicidal deaths making suicide the second leading cause of death globally. Many experts believe that Artificially Intelligent (AI) systems can be leveraged to manage this disease at various stages like early detection, diagnoses and treatment thereby helping mental health practitioners treat it effectively. This review gives an insight to the non-medical community on the basic characteristics of depression and aims to highlight the current trends in using artificial intelligence for the benefit of effectively curing and managing the illness of Depression. We delve into reviewing the behavioral and imaging biomarkers that AI can help effectively identify to detect and manage depression within populations globally.","2020 IEEE International Conference on Informatics, IoT, and Enabling Technologies (ICIoT)",02-05 February 2020,11 May 2020,"Doha, Qatar",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9089576/

There is no effective cure to treat this disease, and it can prove to be deadly to the patient if left untreated or undetected. In this paper, the authors propose a novel DCGAN-based Augmentation and Classification (D-BAC) model approach to identify and classify dementia into various categories depending upon its prominence and severity in the available MRI scans. The proposed detection of early onset of dementia, also referred to as Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI), is also studied with the help of a novel GAN-augmented dataset. The proposed model can predict MCI with an accuracy of 74% and can classify dementia into four categories depending upon its prominence in the MRI scan. The authors have also utilized Visual Explainable A.I. (XAI) and have used GradCAM to visually represent the internal working of the model. This novel approach helps verify the differentiating features of the MRI scans learned by the CNN model during training. Three different datasets, namely the original dataset, geometrically transformed images, and a GAN-augmented dataset, have been used for performance analysis. A comparison of the performance of the CNN model has been made on these datasets, and the superiority of results using the novel GAN-augmented dataset has been studied and discussed. Moreover, progressive resizing has also been applied on this GAN-dataset, and different CNN architectures have also been used to achieve better performance scores.

Risk Metrics to Measure Safety Performance of the National Airspace System: Implementation Using Machine Learning,"['Firdu Bati', 'Fong Lee', 'Ron Bollschweiler', 'Lauren Withington', 'Niloufar Khorrami', 'Igor Filippov', 'Ramesh Adhikari']","Metrics are the key tools to monitor the safety performance of complex systems like air traffic control. Developing risk metrics is a complex process, which involves prediction of risk and identification of different potential outcomes of undesired safety events. For instance, a metric that helps monitor the risk on the surface in an airport environment needs to detect and identify events such as runway excursions, runway incursions, and taxiway incidents and assign appropriate numerical indices proportional to the outcome of each event. An accident with a fatality, injury and aircraft damage will have a corresponding weight for each outcome and incident that involves no outcome can be assigned a severity weight based on its probability of becoming an accident. Models that support such metrics needs to be able to process data from diverse sources. In this paper, we discuss key aspects of two comprehensive metrics that the office of Safety in the Air Traffic Organization has deployed recently: 1) How to employ an automation to detect all relevant events from different data sources and 2) how to assign severity weights for different types of events (accidents and incidents).1. Detection of Relevant Events: one key element of supporting a comprehensive metrics is an automated detection of relevant events by categories. Unlike in aviation, the use of AI and ML have permeated in most industries. Aviation is a safety-critical domain in which there is very little tolerance for failures. The stringent requirements of aviation have contributed to the slow adoption of AI and ML in aviation, in general. However, many aviation sectors are increasingly adopting AI systems, ranging from automating simple, yet tedious and repetitive tasks to a more sophisticated application of a complex autonomous air traffic control system to de-conflict traffic.

An Explainable Machine Learning Framework for Intrusion Detection Systems,"['Maonan Wang', 'Kangfeng Zheng', 'Yanqing Yang', 'Xiujuan Wang']","In recent years, machine learning-based intrusion detection systems (IDSs) have proven to be effective; especially, deep neural networks improve the detection rates of intrusion detection models. However, as models become more and more complex, people can hardly get the explanations behind their decisions. At the same time, most of the works about model interpretation focuses on other fields like computer vision, natural language processing, and biology. This leads to the fact that in practical use, cybersecurity experts can hardly optimize their decisions according to the judgments of the model. To solve these issues, a framework is proposed in this paper to give an explanation for IDSs. This framework uses SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP), and combines local and global explanations to improve the interpretation of IDSs. The local explanations give the reasons why the model makes certain decisions on the specific input. The global explanations give the important features extracted from IDSs, present the relationships between the feature values and different types of attacks. At the same time, the interpretations between two different classifiers, one-vs-all classifier and multiclass classifier, are compared. NSL-KDD dataset is used to test the feasibility of the framework. The framework proposed in this paper leads to improve the transparency of any IDS, and helps the cybersecurity staff have a better understanding of IDSs' judgments. Furthermore, the different interpretations between different kinds of classifiers can also help security experts better design the structures of the IDSs. More importantly, this work is unique in the intrusion detection field, presenting the first use of the SHAP method to give explanations for IDSs.",IEEE Access ( Volume: 8),Not Available,Not Available,Not Available,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9069273/
An Explainable Intrusion Detection System,"['Yun Wang', 'Pan Wang', 'ZiXuan Wang', 'Mengting Cao']","Malicious traffic detection has become a challenge in modern communications. As the research of intrusion detection systems becomes more and more in-depth, from machine learning to deep learning, the accuracy of intrusion detection continues to improve, the complexity of the model is getting higher and higher, and the interpretability of the model is lower. The model is like a black box, it is difficult for people to know the reason behind the decision. In fact, the interpretability of the model has made some achievements in the fields of biology, computer vision, and natural language processing. Therefore, in this article, for an intrusion detection system based on deep neural networks, we propose an interpretable artificial intelligence framework to enhance the transparency of machine learning decision-making, that is, which important features the model uses to determine attack or non attack. We use the SHAP method to explain, and combine local and global explanations to realize IDS interpretation in all directions. The partial explanation gives us the reason why the model makes a decision on a particular instance, which gives us a certain reference value. The global interpretation gives the important characteristics of the model as a whole, which helps to improve the transparency of IDS.

Among various explanation techniques, counterfactual explanations have the advantages of being human-friendly and actionable-a counterfactual explanation tells the user how to gain the desired prediction with minimal changes to the input. Besides, counterfactual explanations can also serve as efficient probes to the models' decisions. In this work, we exploit the potential of counterfactual explanations to understand and explore the behavior of machine learning models. We design DECE, an interactive visualization system that helps understand and explore a model's decisions on individual instances and data subsets, supporting users ranging from decision-subjects to model developers. DECE supports exploratory analysis of model decisions by combining the strengths of counterfactual explanations at instance- and subgroup-levels. We also introduce a set of interactions that enable users to customize the generation of counterfactual explanations to find more actionable ones that can suit their needs. Through three use cases and an expert interview, we demonstrate the effectiveness of DECE in supporting decision exploration tasks and instance explanations.","IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics ( Volume: 27, Issue: 2, February 2021)",Not Available,Not Available,Not Available,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9229232/

Diagnosing Skin Cancer Using Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning,['Riya J. Roy'],"Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) have many applications in the healthcare field. A lifesaving way in which these futuristic tools can be used is to diagnose skin cancer. I developed AI & ML models that can diagnose 7 different forms of skin cancer just from a skin lesion image. My goal was to enable people to upload an image of their skin lesion, and the model will generate a diagnosis for them and a percentage for the diagnosis’ accuracy. Thus, anyone can quickly and easily receive a precise diagnosis. I first researched about skin cancer and found that 1 in 3 cancers are skin cancers, indicating its prevalence. In certain communities, access to professional healthcare is scarce, depriving patients of quality care. To alleviate this, I created a website using AI & ML where people upload a picture of a skin lesion and obtain a diagnosis. Since people upload their own pictures, I had to consider that these images are likely not professional images, but the model should still diagnose it. Hence, I performed data augmentation on my dataset of skin lesion images. I made duplicates of my dataset and manipulated them by flipping, blurring, resizing, or zooming them using OpenCV. I then created numerous machine learning models such as K Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), Grid Search CNN, and Transfer Learning, to determine which model best diagnoses the different skin cancers. I evaluated the models using the Receiver Operator Curve (ROC), which shows the relationship between a model’s true positive and true negative rate. To interpret the curve, I used the Area Under the Curve (AUC) metric, which compares the model to one which randomly guesses. Additionally, I plotted Confusion Matrices to view a detailed configuration of each model’s performance. After evaluating, I found that my Transfer Model performed the best.

IoV has become an important research area of impactful applications in recent years due to the rapid advancements in vehicular technologies, high throughput satellite communication, the Internet of Things, and cyber-physical systems. IoV enables the integration of smart vehicles with the Internet and system components attributing to their environments, such as public infrastructures, sensors, computing nodes, pedestrians, and other vehicles. By allowing the development of a common information exchange platform between vehicles and heterogeneous vehicular networks, this integration aims to create a better environment and public space for the people as well as to enhance safety for all road users. Being a participatory data exchange and storage, the underlying information exchange platform of IoV needs to be secure, transparent, and immutable in order to achieve the intended objectives of ITS. In this connection, the adoption of blockchain as a system platform for supporting the information exchange needs of IoV has been explored. Due to their decentralized and immutable nature, IoV applications enabled by blockchain are believed to have a number of desirable properties, such as decentralization, security, transparency, immutability, and automation.

This disease has continuously growing stages to halt entire neural activities of any people. There are many techniques proposed to detect and predict PD using medical symptoms and measurements. The medical measurements provided by different experiments must be effectively handled to produce concrete results on the detection of PD. This saves many people from PD at earlier stage itself. Recent technologies focus on Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL) techniques for effective PD data analysis for making efficient prediction system.

Watch Where You’re Going! Gaze and Head Orientation as Predictors for Social Robot Navigation,"['Blake Holman', 'Abrar Anwar', 'Akash Singh', 'Mauricio Tec', 'Justin Hart', 'Peter Stone']","Mobile robots deployed in human-populated environments must be able to safely and comfortably navigate in close proximity to people. Head orientation and gaze are both mechanisms which help people to interpret where other people intend to walk, which in turn enables them to coordinate their movement. Head orientation has previously been leveraged to develop classifiers which are able to predict the goal of a person’s walking motion. Gaze is believed to generally precede head orientation, with a person quickly moving their eyes to a target and then following it with a turn of their head. This study leverages state-of-the-art virtual reality technology to place participants into a simulated environment in which their gaze and motion can be observed. The results of this study indicate that position, velocity, head orientation, and gaze can all be used as predictive features of the goal of a person’s walking motion. The results also indicate that gaze both precedes head orientation and can be used to predict the goal of a person’s walking motion at a higher level of accuracy earlier in their walking trajectory.

Improving Person Re-Identification Based on Human Height Information,"['Takahiro Yoshioka', 'Shuji Awai', 'Takeshi Konno']","Over the last few decades, threats to urban security have increased worldwide. Surveillance solutions aim to detect, track, and identify people of interest using a large number of surveillance camera videos. In particular, in Japan, the police force expects surveillance solutions to help criminal tracking. As the number of surveillance cameras has increased in recent years, manual analysis has reached its limit, resulting in a high expectation for automatic analysis using artificial intelligence (AI). The AI study on person re-identification has a high potential for human verification in academia; however, it is still challenging to apply. This is because practical tracking accuracy cannot be obtained when a person changes clothes on the assumption that the criminal is on the run. Therefore, we have developed and evaluated an AI technology that identifies people in a scene by focusing on human height, a body characteristic that does not change. To estimate the height from the video, it is necessary to obtain the camera specific parameters. It is difficult to estimate the parameters of many existing cameras because well-known and other conventional camera calibration methods require tedious manual procedures and preliminary information such as objects of known length to estimate the camera parameters. Therefore, we developed a high-precision height estimation method that does not require prior knowledge or the complicated manual procedure by estimating camera parameters using the skeleton of a person captured by a surveillance camera. Moreover, we developed a method that can determine whether a person is the same person even if the person's clothes change using the human height, representing one of the characteristics unique to the person, together with the image features. When evaluating images to identify similarity in people in different clothing captured at size of >200 pixels, the mean average precision improved by 64.8% compared with the conventional method, th...

Novel Application to Improve Communication for Children Affected by Autism Spectrum Disorder,['Veda R Murthy'],"Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is a spectrum of disorders that affects a child’s communication, social, and emotional skills. ASD is a major challenge for children because they are not able to communicate effectively with others, especially in terms of conveying their emotions. For the 40% of ASD children who are mute and are not able to verbalize their emotions, facial expressions are the primary indicator that family members and caregivers use to recognize their emotion. ASD children display facial features unique to each child, so those who are unfamiliar with the child such as teachers may find it difficult to interpret the child’s emotions. This creates a communication barrier between ASD children and the outside world, leading to frustration and isolation among the 13.7 million ASD children around the world. Current solutions to help ASD children socialize, such as speech practising or assisted learning apps, do not reduce this barrier. This is because these apps are not an immediate solution to this barrier, and can be effective only after months of practice by the child. Also, most of these solutions do not work for mute ASD children. Thus, there is a dire need for an individualized solution that interprets an ASD child’s emotion. My solution is the Cognitive Emotion Interpretation App (CEIA). CEIA uses Artificial Intelligence and Emotion Recognition Technology to map an ASD child’s facial expressions with an emotion. Through CEIA, people who are not familiar with the ASD child (teachers, extended family) can interpret the child’s emotion. When a user (parent, caregiver) downloads the app, they upload photos of the ASD child expressing different emotions and tag the picture with the emotion (e.g. Happy, Sad, Frustrated, Hungry). CEIA then extracts the child’s facial features, and the AI algorithm is trained to associate the picture with the emotion.

Cross-Modal Collaborative Representation Learning and a Large-Scale RGBT Benchmark for Crowd Counting,"['Lingbo Liu', 'Jiaqi Chen', 'Hefeng Wu', 'Guanbin Li', 'Chenglong Li', 'Liang Lin']","Crowd counting is a fundamental yet challenging task, which desires rich information to generate pixel-wise crowd density maps. However, most previous methods only used the limited information of RGB images and cannot well discover potential pedestrians in unconstrained scenarios. In this work, we find that incorporating optical and thermal information can greatly help to recognize pedestrians. To promote future researches in this field, we introduce a large-scale RGBT Crowd Counting (RGBT-CC) benchmark, which contains 2,030 pairs of RGB-thermal images with 138,389 annotated people. Furthermore, to facilitate the multimodal crowd counting, we propose a cross-modal collaborative representation learning framework, which consists of multiple modality-specific branches, a modality-shared branch, and an Information Aggregation-Distribution Module (IADM) to capture the complementary information of different modalities fully. Specifically, our IADM incorporates two collaborative information transfers to dynamically enhance the modality-shared and modality-specific representations with a dual information propagation mechanism. Extensive experiments conducted on the RGBT-CC benchmark demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework for RGBT crowd counting.

This model utilizes the inter-and-intra individual correlations and constraints, at both micro-activity and macro-activity levels, to recognize individual activities accurately. These constraints are learnt automatically using data-mining techniques, and help to dramatically reduce the computational complexity of HDBN-based inferencing. Empirical studies using a real-world testbed of five multi-inhabitant smarthomes shows that CACE is able to achieve an activity recognition accuracy of 95%, with a 16-fold reduction in computational overhead compared to traditional hybrid classification approaches.","IEEE Transactions on Mobile Computing ( Volume: 20, Issue: 1, 01 January 2021)",Not Available,Not Available,Not Available,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8821405/
Automatic Question Generation for Repeated Testing to Improve Student Learning Outcome,"['Danny C.L. Tsai', 'Anna Y.Q. Huang', 'Owen H.T. Lu', 'Stephen J.H. Yang']","In recent years, educational resources have gradually been digitized, and digital education platforms have gradually become popular. We use AI to accurately assist people in performing daily tasks through a machine learning process. In education, we can use AI in many situations, such as predicting student's learning outcome and discovering student's learning strategies. However, most solutions have not yet utilized modern AI capabilities, such as natural language processing. This research aims to help teachers use machines to automatically generate short answer questions to reduce the time for teachers to write exam questions. In addition, the main reason we focus on short answers is that many studies prove that short answer exercises can enhance student's long-term memory, thereby improving their learning performance. We propose an automatic question generation (AQG) system that combines syntax-base and semantics-base, in order to prove that the system is highly available and improve student's learning performance, we conducted experiments with 41 students. The experimental results show that student's learning performance has been significantly improved, which means that by repeatedly testing the machine question generation system, students can deepen their long-term memory of course knowledge.",2021 International Conference on Advanced Learning Technologies (ICALT),12-15 July 2021,02 August 2021,"Tartu, Estonia",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9499754/

Deep Neural Architecture for Face mask Detection on Simulated Masked Face Dataset against Covid-19 Pandemic,"['Alok Negi', 'Krishan Kumar', 'Prachi Chauhan', 'R.S. Rajput']","The dangerous COVID-19 (SARS-CoV-2) is rising steadily and globally, with more than 72,851,747 confirmed cases observed to WHO including 1,643,339 deaths till 17 December 2020. The country’s economy is now almost fully halted, people are stuck up and investment becomes deteriorating. So, this is turning to worry of the government for a development and health. Health organizations are often desperate for evolving decision-making innovations to overcome this viral virus and encourage people to receive rapid and effective responses in real-time. Thus, it is important to create auto-mechanisms as a preventive shield to ensure healthy humanity against SARS-CoV-2. Advanced analytics methods and other strategies could also empower researchers, learners and the pharmaceutical industry to acknowledge the hazardous COVID-19 and speed it up care procedures by efficiently testing vast volumes of research data. The prevention method consequence is being used to effectively manage, calculate, forecast and monitor current infected people and future potential cases. Therefore, we proposed CNN and VGG16 based deep learning models to incorporate and enforce AI-based precautionary measures to detect the face mask on Simulated Masked Face Dataset (SMFD). This technique is capable of recognizing masked and unmasked faces to help monitor safety breaches, facilitate the use of face masks, and maintain a secure working atmosphere.","2021 International Conference on Computing, Communication, and Intelligent Systems (ICCCIS)",19-20 February 2021,12 April 2021,"Greater Noida, India",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9397196/

WanderMate: GPS based bus tracking interface system,"['Regish Nedumannil George', 'P John Zachariah', 'Rahul Mohan', 'Mohammad Yaseen', 'Binu John']","Inaccuracy of data given on certain websites, absence of information on intermediate bus stops, constant delay of buses are few of the inconveniences one faces while travelling. A person travelling at odd times might not be able to ask details to people regarding buses and their timings and the constant worry that, “Will I miss my stop?” makes anyone's journey a big headache. Even though there are a bunch of apps today in the market to solve these problems individually, we have developed an application, WanderMate that helps keep track of pretty much all information one would require to use public bus transport in the most efficient way as possible and that too all under one roof. WanderMate is designed to help the public overcome most of the difficulties that one would face during the use and reliance on public bus transportation for commute and other travel purposes. The application uses AI techniques to provide facilities such as navigation to those bus stops/stations if the user doesn't know the way. Another useful feature is the implementation of real-time bus services from each stop so that the user doesn't have to rely on strangers to know when the next bus is. Also our smart location alarm feature which as the name suggests alerts you by ringing an alarm when you are within close range of your destination. This app is our way of conveying to the people “It's time to enjoy your journey not worry about it.”","2021 International Conference on Innovative Computing, Intelligent Communication and Smart Electrical Systems (ICSES)",24-25 September 2021,16 December 2021,"Chennai, India",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9633973/
Design and Feasibility Analysis of an Artificial Intelligence Based Mobile App for Maintaining Kinship in an Affinity Group,"['Nusrat Jahan', 'Tasfiqul Ghani', 'Sadman Hossain Ridoy', 'Md. Saif Khan', 'Mohammad Monirujjaman Khan']","In this paper, we introduce a mobile application named ""No Space"". No Space can be used to let people know where their loved ones are and be aware of their activities. This is done with the help of numerous features that are available in this application. Both concerned individuals and targeted family members need to have this application installed on their mobile devices. The basic features provided by this application are the messaging service and the video sharing feature by which they can share live events. The messaging service can be extensively used to send attachments like pictures or videos. Users, by allowing location services from the phone’s settings, can share their real time whereabouts from the map with their loved ones. In case of an emergency, this application is designed to use its Artificial Intelligent (AI) feature, called the ""shout for help"", which will help the user reach the victim following the shortest path to the destination on the map. Users can also easily notify their loved ones to consume food and water or take medications on their designated times through simple click features. In doing so, this sets an alarm in the concerned and connected users’ phones. Even though the adults spend most of their days at work, this mobile application allows developing a healthy relationship among them and the old and young family members. In this paper, model design, performance analysis and control of No Space is elaborately discussed.",2020 Second International Sustainability and Resilience Conference: Technology and Innovation in Building Designs(51154),11-12 November 2020,18 January 2021,"Sakheer, Bahrain",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9319995/
